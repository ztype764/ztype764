Yoohoo! Ztype here(Aka Ali Umar). 
I'm an engineeting student currently studying electronics and coding.
My strong language rn is C only, i do have some experience with HTML and css too.

The purpose of this git is holding my projects (which i deem uploadable ;_; ) so that i can improve them later.
*The upload deemability tag will be under extreme scrunity by me so expect only a few uploads in years ðŸ™‚
