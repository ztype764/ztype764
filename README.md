Z in!
I'm an engineeting student currently studying electronics and coding.
My strong language rn is Java adn i'm somewhat used to coding in python and C, I learnt a little HTML and CSS on the side too.

The purpose of this git is holding my projects (which i deem uploadable ;_; ) so that i can improve them later.
*The upload deemability tag will be under extreme scrunity by me so expect only a few uploads in years ðŸ™‚
