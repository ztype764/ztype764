SDE keeping up with programming, electronics,digital & analog comm.

100% Java and Spring right now, I learnt a little HTML and CSS on the side too and I can write some basic code in React.js.

I have been working in web app development projects for a while so I do have some knowledge about MERN Stack,RTC(websockets and such).

----
The purpose of this git is holding my projects (which i deem uploadable ;_; ) so that i can improve them later.

**The upload deemability tag will be under extreme scrunity by me so expect only a few uploads in years** ðŸ™‚
