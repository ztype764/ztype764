**Z in!**
----
I'm a uni student currently studying electronics,digital & analog comm. and programming.

100% Java and Spring right now but I'm somewhat used to coding in python and C, I learnt a little HTML and CSS on the side too and now i can write some basic code in javascript too.

I have been working in web ap development projects so i do have some knowledge about MERN Stack(can create basic MERN stack apps).

----
The purpose of this git is holding my projects (which i deem uploadable ;_; ) so that i can improve them later.

**The upload deemability tag will be under extreme scrunity by me so expect only a few uploads in years** ðŸ™‚
