Z in!

I'm a uni student currently studying electronics,digital & analog comm. and coding.
Im practising Java right now i'm somewhat used to coding in python and C, I learnt a little HTML and CSS on the side too.

The purpose of this git is holding my projects (which i deem uploadable ;_; ) so that i can improve them later.

**The upload deemability tag will be under extreme scrunity by me so expect only a few uploads in years** ðŸ™‚
